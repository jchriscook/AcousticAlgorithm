# AcousticAlgorithm
A repository for locating tornados during development


To use the tool to process .mat audio files:
  -> clone the directory to your local machine in a location of your choice
  -> in your comand window in Matlab cd into the directory "Code" where you can see main.m and PlottingClass.m when you list the files (ls)
  -> run main.m either from the button, or from the command window by run('main.m')
